            <h3>How to Use</h3>
            <p>Use the 400 Blush Brush to blend powder blushes evenly for a natural yet, buildable flush. Use the 300 Deluxe Crease Brush to blend cream and powder eyeshadows evenly- or, use it to blend concealer. Use the 402 Setting Brush to dust on highlighter or setting powder. Use the 200 Expert Face Brush to buff liquid and cream foundations- also acts as the perfect tool to create a seamless contour. Miracle Complexion Sponge: Use RT's signature 3-point application technique. Use the flat edge to apply and cover, the round sides to blend and blur, and the precision tip to conceal and perfect. Use damp for a natural, dewy finish.</p>
